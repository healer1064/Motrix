Support downloading HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet, Baidu Net Disk and other resources.

Hello everyone, I am an interested desktop application developer 🤓. I developed a full-featured download manager in my spare time for my hobbies. Its name is Motrix. I completed its interface design, application icons, completed most of the coding, and opened it source.

I think that its interface is beautiful, easy to operate, and rich in configuration 😌, I hope you will like it 👻.
